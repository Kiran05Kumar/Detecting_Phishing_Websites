Detecting Phishing Websites
---------------------------
Data phishing has become a widespread and effective method used by cybercriminals to deceive individuals and unlawfully acquire their personal and financial information. In our increasingly internet-dependent world, where we conduct many of our daily activities online, fraudsters have found a prime environment for executing targeted phishing attacks. These modern phishing attempts have grown remarkably sophisticated, making them harder to detect. Alarmingly, a recent study conducted by Intel revealed that a staggering 97% of security experts were unable to distinguish between genuine emails and phishing emails. This concerning statistic highlights the urgent need for a better understanding of data phishing and the implementation of strong countermeasures to protect ourselves from these deceptive attacks.
